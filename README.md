## BUSINESS NEEDS

* The responsive format transitions from single column on small screens with mobile Slick-nav menu, to two columns and three column views.
* A jQuery script places sidebar content below main content on smaller format screens.
* Videos on the home page are pulled through a random database call.
* Page and post urls are rewritten to provide better SEO value.
